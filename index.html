    <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Introduction to Central Nervous System (CNS)</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord. CNS is one of two parts of the nervous system.
        The other part is the peripheral nervous system, which consists of nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body.
CNS controls body functions like awareness, movement, thinking, and speech. While the spinal cord carries messages and connects to the brainstem through peripheral nerves.

<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Epilepsy</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder involving recurring seizures, affecting people of all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds, and ages.
    There are many types of epilepsy. In some people, the cause of seizures can be identified.
    In others, the cause is not known. Symptoms can vary, with some losing awareness, others staring blankly, and others twitching their arms or legs.
    A single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy, it's diagnosed when at least two unjustified seizures occur at least 24 hours apart.
    Treatment with medicines or surgery can control seizures. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age, while others require lifelong care.    
           </p>
           <hr>
           <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Symptoms</h1>
           <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure.
            Because epilepsy is caused by certain activity in the brain, seizures can affect any brain process.
            <br>
            Seizure symptoms may include:
            <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                <li>Temporary confusion.</li>
                <li>A staring spell.</li>
                <li>Stiff muscles.</li>
                <li>Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs.</li>
                <li>Loss of consciousness.</li>
                <li>Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu.</li>
                <li>Sometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behaviour (for example psychosis).</li>
            </ul>
           </p>
           <p style="font-size: 20px;">Most people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time. Symptoms are usually similar from episode to episode.</p>
           <hr>
           <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Types of seizures</h1>
           <p style="font-size: 20px;">Typically, seizures are classified into primary generalised seizures and focal (previously called partial) seizures.
            The difference between them is what the name says.
            Typically primary generalized seizures begin abruptly with electrical discharge involving both sides of the brain, loss of consciousness,
            muscle contraction, and upward deviation of the eyes. While focal seizures begin with an electrical discharge in a limited area,
            patients may have semi-purposeful movements of the mouth (chewing, lip pursing, and tongue protrusion)
            or extremities (rubbing of fingers, jerking movements of hands or/and feet, etc. ) and patients may be aware of what’s happening.
            Focal seizures can also be caused by head injury, brain infection, stroke, tumour, etc.
            Classifying seizures depends on whether consciousness (the ability to respond and remember) is damaged or preserved.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following factors may increase the risk of seizures in people predisposed to seizures:
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                <li>Stress.</li>
                <li>Sleep deprivation or fatigue.</li>
                <li>Insufficient food intake.</li>
                <li>Alcohol use or drug abuse.</li>
                <li>Failure to take prescribed anticonvulsant medications.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">How and when do epilepsy seizures start?</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Some seizures start in response to particular situations as if the seizure is a "reflex."
                There is a type of epilepsy called “reflex epilepsy” which is a type of epilepsy where seizures occur consistently to a specific trigger.
                Most generalized seizures occur at night with convulsions. Focal seizures occur during the day with speech arrest, and drooling from the mouth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Photosensitive epilepsy is a type of reflex epilepsy where seizures are triggered by flashing lights, while other types may be triggered by reading or noises.
                <br>
                <br>
                Understanding these types of epilepsies and recognizing them can help to manage the condition effectively.
